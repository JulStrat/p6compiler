As mentioned elsewhere, I was looking for a suitable &#8220;base&#8221; for
developing a WD compiler, found Scott's P5 sources, and got
distracted. I just <i>had</i> to fiddle with a
few things and wound up doing a <i>lot</i> of fiddling with the P5
sources (BTW, thanks, Scott!), implementing the level 1 &#8220;conformant array parameter&#8221;
feature among other things, and thus, ending up with P6.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">I
agree with Scott regarding the criteria for the compiler, that it 1)
be ISO 7185-compliant, 2) can compile itself, 3) can compile any
reasonable standard program, 4) be efficient enough to be used for
application development (even if a different native-code compiler is
used for production), and 5) can serve as a starting implementation
for native-code compilers. I would also add that it would be nice to
have sources that are clear enough to be suitable for study in a 300-
or 400- level course in practical compiler construction. (Being
public-domain, no permissions are required for this.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">A
person with a lot of patience could track the changes from the P4
sources from Niklaus Wirth and his students, through Scott's P5
sources, and then to the current P6 sources. Hopefully, readers of
this source will not be put off by my predilection for capitalizing
reserved words to set them off from user-defined identifiers (as is
done in the later Wirth-designed languages Modula and Oberon). Also,
I found it difficult to understand code that did not follow an
indentation policy. It is not so important <i>which</i>
indentation policy is used, as much as <i>having</i>
one that is applied consistently. So I manually 'pretty-printed' the
sources of the compiler, pcom.pas, and the interpreter, pint.pas, to
make them more readable, i.e., readable to me. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gries" target="_blank">David Gries</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-Programming-Monographs-Computer/dp/038790641X/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=" target="_blank">The
Science of Programming</a> (1981) ch. 22.1)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">The
biggest (substantive) changes that I made to pcom.pas are:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">1.
I completed the change-over from long strings to linked lists of
short strings, begun by Scott in the P5 source. The scanner
('insymbol') now generates these linked lists when inputting
identifiers, numbers, or character strings of any length. So now
there are no limitations on the lengths of these tokens. There was a
considerable amount of overhead in going back and forth between large
character strings and the linked lists that is now eliminated. As a
result, compilation speed is greatly increased.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">2.
The handling of parameters in the program header is regularized. The
required variables 'input' and 'output' still obey the requirements
of ISO 7185, of course, but any additional parameters allowed by the
Standard are for communicating with the external world. Parameters of
a non-file type are implementation-dependent features, and a
standard-conforming program may not rely on any interpretation of
them. However, program parameters of type 'file', are considered to
be implementation-defined, and a standard-conforming program MAY rely
on a such a feature. I chose to allow for additional textfiles with a
flexible and predictable binding to external files to take the place
of the built-in (and non-standard) 'prr' and 'prd'. This
interpretation of the Standard enables the compiler to self-compile
without having to employ any 'extensions' to ISO 7185 to make that
possible. There are still a couple places where "$ifdef __GPC__"
is used (in a comment) so that gpc, the GNU Pascal compiler, can be
used to create the first pcom.exe file. Once a working p-code file is
produced, those sections can go away, and then you'll hold in the
palm of your computer the first source that is self-compiling and is
an ISO 7185 Standard-conforming program. (OK, there are still a few
errors not detected: one is the 'intval' field in variables of type
'valu' which is never set, and therefore the variants controlled by
this field are 'invalid'. We'll get this cleaned up someday.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">3.
Also the inclusion of 'commandline' in the list of program parameters
will enable a Pascal program to read the command line with which the
program was invoked. This seemed like a good idea at the time . . . 
The compiler does not rely on this implementation-dependent feature.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">4.
I changed 'lca' back toward the way P4 was doing it. (Sorry, Scott!)
I don't see the need for the compiler to double the apostrophes
embedded in the instruction, just so that the interpreter can un-do
it. If "'doesn't'" doesn't look right then the delimiters
are now changed to "|", so that "lca 7 'doesn''t'"
is now "loca 7 |doesn't|". No biggy, but doesn't that look
better? (And now it's called &#8220;loca&#8221;; it still means "load constant address".)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">5.
I implemented a very rudimentary amount of conditional compilation,
just enough to let gpc (the GNU Pascal compiler) be the first compile
to get things bootstrapped. It's not standard-conforming; it's rather
old-fashioned: the better way is to import &amp; export interfaces, à
la Modula and Oberon, etc. I'll leave the conditional
compile code in pcom.pas (for bootstrapping purposes), but strip it
out of the self-compiling p6com.pas.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">6.
A certain amount of improvement in code generation is due to a
nascent 'peephole' optimizer in pcom.pas.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">7.
Some of the restrictions on the for statement's control variable are
enforced, resulting in more of the Pascal Validation Suite tests
being passed. (See Pascal News, #16.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">8.
Sets are no longer always 32 bytes long (to handle 'SET OF char').
They are only as long as they need to be. Since you don't know at
compile-time how many elements a set constructor will use, they still
use 32 bytes, so as not to break anything that worked in P5.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">9.
And, finally, there are now conformant array parameters. Ahem,
<span style="font-weight: normal;">&#8220;Pascal
P6, v1.0&#8221; complies with the requirements of level 1 of</span>
ISO/IEC 7185.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">And
now, regarding the interpreter:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">I
have made some substantial changes to pint.pas. My philosophy
regarding interpreters differs from Scott's. He regards the
interpreter as being an important test case for the Pascal compiler
itself. And so he adhered to the ISO standard in terms of the source
language used, and thus pint.pas can be compiled with the pcom
compiler. It started out that way, of
course, for the Zürich
folks because then the challenge was to bootstrap any
subset of the language at all in order to get things going. Now that
there is a wider choice of Pascal compilers, the question is raised:
what should be used to create an executable file for the interpreter.
And that, in turn, raises the question, can the interpreter benefit from
extensions in the Pascal dialect that is used to implement the
interpreter?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">My
opinion is that the interpreter should be made to run <i>fast</i>,
as long as the criterion of portability is not sacrificed.
Some loops for effecting the transfer of data have been unfolded
manually, since the GNU Pascal compiler wouldn't do it, even with the
highest optimization levels specified. This is unfortunate because
now these code sequences would need to be changed if intsize and
adrsize were to be defined with other values.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">But
the increased interpreter performance makes this change worthwhile.
Your opinion may differ, of course. The overall speed of the system
(as measured by the self-compile time) has been substantially
improved. I think this makes Pascal a much more 'user-friendly'
language for developing software.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">Back
to the question of which compiler to use to compile the interpreter,
there are two prominent choices that have a following across a
multitude of architectures and operating systems: GNU Pascal and Free
Pascal. GNU has the advantage that it will compile pcom.pas;
therefore, I regard it as preferable overall.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">The
biggest, most obvious change is in the capitalization of reserved
words, as I noted about pcom.pas. This makes the source much more
readable to me, and hopefully also to you. You will recognize this
built-in style in the languages Modula-2 and Oberon. The same thing
goes for the indentation style.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">The
biggest substantive change from P5 to P6 is in the re-vamping of
opcodes. See the Appendix regarding P-codes in the P6-v1-manual.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">Of
course, making changes to the underlying P-machine, in terms of sizes
of integers, pointers and reals, is still quite an undertaking.
Hopefully, that problem will be tackled in the <a href="P6-v2.html" target="_blank">v2.0</a><a href="p6-v2.html" target="_blank"></a> release. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">And,
of course, there are other changes:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">1.
I simplified the dynamic allocation routines. There is now a sentinel
value of 'zero length' at the top of the heap that tells a routine
that is walking through the chain of blocks to 'stop' when it gets to
this sentinel. The new strategy is to simply re-use blocks that have
been allocated previously. There is now no attempt to fragment larger
blocks or to coalesce smaller blocks back into larger ones. This is
sub-optimal for the more general allocation problem, but is optimized
for applications, like compilers, which are constantly using and
re-using blocks of only a few different fixed lengths. (You want to
build a fancier heap mechanism than this? Maybe with reference counts
and other geegaws? Go ahead! That's what these sources are for.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">2.
I find the entire mark stack mechanism to be old-fashioned, and
somewhat peculiar. Wirth was familiar with the way Burroughs
implemented Algol 60 on their B5000/B5500 series of computers, and
adopted the same mechanism for Pascal. I would rather get rid of the
mark stack altogether, and may do so in v2.0. At least I was able to
reduce the size of a stack mark from 32 bytes to 20 bytes, and get
rid of the 'ente' p-code. (Implementing value conformant array
parameters, by making a copy of the caller's actual argument in the
callee's frame, required a different way of implementing
inter-procedural gotos from the method in P5.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">3.
Beware of getInt, putInt, getAddr and putAddr. I was disappointed
that gpc didn't unfold the loops, even at the highest optimization
levels. So I unfolded them manually, at the source level. If wordsize
or adrsize change from 4, then these routines would have to change as
well. Sorry about that. But I consider the speedup to be worth it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">4.
Just as with pcom.pas, if I didn't understand something, I re-wrote
it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">5.
The offset and size fields of most opcodes are shortened, as
described in the manual.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">6.
Almost forget: I separated the 'unified' space into a code space and
a data space. I found that I could get the code for pcom to fit
easily within 64K bytes. One of the benefits of this is that code
addresses can be reduced to just 2 bytes (16 bits). I also changed
code address fields from absolute addresses (indicies, really) to
pc-relative offsets. This <i>almost</i>
results in position-independent code. For a larger
application, the 4-byte code addresses can be restored without much
difficulty, but I would rather find yet more ways to make the code   
sizes smaller. Andrew S. Tanenbaum, et al., have invented virtual
machine instruction sets that are a <i>lot</i>
more compact.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">The
compiler generally needs less than 64K bytes of data to self-compile,
but I didn't see any point in making data addresses less than 4
bytes. (Once you go down that road, you then have to make integers
fit into 16 bits, and before you know it, you are back in the nasty
old 1980s with itsy-bitsy memory buses!)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">I
wish to thank my friend David M. Cooper, one of those computer
polymaths that CalPoly (Pomona) produces in such abundance. His
ability to retrieve answers for any question I had, plus his
enthusiasm and encouragement, greatly accelerated this project.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">The
easiest way to compile pcom.pas is with the GNU Pascal Compiler
(gpc). Hats off to the GNUers! Free Pascal 3.0.0 works well for many
things (and I love how they integrated gdb, the GNU debugger, into
their IDE). But it cannot be used to produce the first pcom.exe.
Trust me. I wasted too much time trying to get that to work. The Free
Pascal language and implementation is just a bit too non-standard and
idiosyncratic to use with pcom.pas.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;">Using
it to compile the interpreter, however, is a different story. It
would be nice to have an interpreter that could be compiled with
<i>either</i> GNU Pascal <i>or</i> Free Pascal. Dave is working on
it. Stay tuned.</p>
