<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">My ultimate goal is to
implement a programming language that incorporates </font><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: normal;">the
notation that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Edsger
W. Dijkstra</a> introduced in his book </span></font><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_12?url=search-alias=stripbooks&amp;field-keywords=a+discipline+of+programming&amp;sprefix=a+discipline,aps,287&amp;crid=1SMRC247T6KD1"><font size="3"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">A

into a proven schema such as Wirth's new, amazingly simple, yet
powerful, Oberon-07. Dijkstra's book</font><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: normal;">
introduced 1) guarded commands for handling alternative and iterative
control structures, 2) active and passive scopes of variables (and
constants), 3) nomenclature declarations for the controlled
inheritance of global entities into a block that help to support the
active and passive scopes, and 4) more explicit controls over
extending, deleting and updating array elements so that arrays obey
the active and passive scope rules.</span></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">I am calling this new
language WD. (Hopefully, we'll never get up to version 40, because I
think </font><font size="3"><i>that</i></font><font size="3">
name is already taken.) With any luck we'll be able to take all the
programming examples out of Dijkstra's book and directly execute
them. (And since he proved them correct, they better work!)</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></font><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Those unfamiliar with
Dijkstra's revolutionary ideas really need to read his book. An
elaboration of these ideas that might be an easier read is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gries">Prof.
David Gries</a>' book </span></font><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-Programming-Monographs-Computer/dp/0387964800"><font size="3"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">The

families of programming languages are used in a fashion that are both
tutorials on the languages being described as well as tutorials on
how to develop programs with correctness in mind. See also his
classic book </span></span></font><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Structures-Prentice-Hall-Automatic-Computation/dp/0130224189/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486234806&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=wirth+algorithms+++data+structures"><font size="3"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">Algorithms

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">One problem with developing such a compiler is that
Dijkstra used many symbols that are not in the ASCII character set,
for example the &#8220;box&#8221; symbol used to separate the guarded
commands within an &#8220;if&#8221; statement or &#8220;do&#8221; statement. It can
be simulated by adjacent square brackets: []. Similarly, combinations
of two ASCII symbols (&#8220;digraphs&#8221;) can be used to form the rest of
the symbols used in his book. As the file mentioned above suggests,
an editor which knows about these digraphs might do an automatic job
of simulating the look of the notation in the book, while maintaining
a strict &#8220;ASCII-only&#8221; policy for the source input.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">A second problem is that Dijkstra only intended to
illustrate that a simple, precise notation could be used to
illustrate the construction of algorithms whose correctness was
evident, or could be proven using propositional logic or first-order
predicate logic. He was not trying to invent a new programming
language. Therefore, he never bothered to specify what &#8220;modules&#8221;
or &#8220;procedures&#8221; would look like. His notation is in need of a
&#8220;wrapper&#8221;. I believe that Niklaus Wirth's latest language,
<a href="http://oberon07.com/">Oberon-07</a>, would be the ideal
&#8220;wrapper&#8221;.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">Some of Dijkstra's influence can be seen already in the
definition of Wirth's Oberon-07. For instance, Wirth has introduced
WHILE statements with multiple &#8220;guards&#8221;. Also he has gotten rid
of the LOOP statement, as well as the EXIT and RETURN statements,
i.e., anything that smacks of a GOTO, no matter how well disguised.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">Another way that Dijkstra's influence can be seen is in
Wirth's definition of the FOR loop. In Pascal, Wirth made the control
variable become &#8220;undefined&#8221; after the execution of a FOR
statement (whether or not the loop was ever executed), with the
single exception that a GOTO out of the loop caused the value of the
control variable at that point to be defined. This was intended to
give the compiler writer a lot of latitude in how to implement the
FOR statement.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">In Oberon-07, however, Wirth defines the semantics of
the FOR loop in enough detail that the value of the control variable
is known with certainty following execution of the FOR statement.
Thus, Dijkstra's protocol for determining the &#8220;active&#8221; scope of
this variable is not violated.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">Anyone who has not taken a close look at Oberon is
missing out on an important discovery. Wirth is able to duplicate the
functionality of so-called &#8220;object-oriented&#8221; programming using a
very few, but powerful, features that begin with his extensible
record (and pointer) types.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">Therefore, the overall plan is to use Pascal P6 (with a
few extensions taken from Extended Pascal: e.g. modules, constant
expressions, strings) and develop Oberon-07 (using LLVM IR
as the intermediate language) and then turn that into WD.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">So the follow-on projects will be 1) doing most or all
of the stuff&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>for <a href="P6-v2.html" target="_blank">P6 v2.0</a>, 2) hooking up Pascal P6 v2.0 to the LLVM tool chain (v3.0),
3) adding a few useful extensions (P7, v0.9?), 4) modifying that to be an
Oberon-07 front end (O7, v1.0), and finally 5) implementing a WD front end.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">One side project will be to develop an IDE/editor that
makes WD programs look very much like what they look like in &#8220;A
Discipline of Programming&#8221;. Click <a href="example.html" target="_blank">here</a> for an example..</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">One good reason for tying into the LLVM tool chain is
have interoperability with other languages used to build system
software. Modules and utilities implemented in WD could then be
substituted piece-by-piece with components of, say, Unix or Linux or
even the LLVM tool chain itself.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">I dream of an software system that is proven to be
correct, starting from the hardware specification, and working
through correctness proofs and assertions in WD! (&#8220;They-ey
say-ay-ay-ay I'm a dreamer . . . .  But I'm not the only one . . .&#8221;)</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">Another reason to tie into the LLVM tool chain, besides
piggybacking off all that back-end capability, is to have a really
aggressive optimizer. Of course, to be a suitable replacement for
FORTRAN, WD would need to offer number-crunching capabilities. That
implies implementing the complex data type and having a really
extensive library of mathematical functions. This could probably be
done using operator overloading and importable modules, rather than
having to extend the core language. Also useful would be having an
automatic parallelization and vectorization capability built into the
front end to exploit the increasingly multi-core and SIMD processor
designs.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left">
<font size="3">It will take a lot to wean older coders away from the
&#8220;C&#8221; and Fortran families. They must start using a language that
promotes &#8220;proof of correctness&#8221;, and trust the compiler to
generate compact and efficient object code.</font></p>

<font size="3">If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil">Ray
Kurzweil</a> is right, then sometime in the mid-to-late 2030s, we'll
have nanotechnology available to destroy cancer cells and perhaps zap
blood clots in the brain as soon as they form. If you wind up with a
network of billions of nanobots running around in your bloodstream,
wouldn't you rather have them programmed using something more
reliable than 40-year-old software engineering paradigms?</font></p><p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;" align="left"><font size="3">Consider&nbsp;becoming a <a href="https://www.wirth-dijkstra-langs.org/sponsor.html" target="_blank">sponsor</a> of this effort.</font></p></body></html>
